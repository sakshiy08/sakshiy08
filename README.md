- 👋 Hi, I’m SAKSHI
- 📍 I am based in Bengaluru, India
- 👩🏻‍💻 I’m currently learning machine learning and its applications in single-cell spatial transcriptomics analysis
- 🤝🏼 I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to NGS data analysis and machine learning
- 📩 Reach me at sakshiydv08@gmail.com – I reply faster than a DNA polymerase replicating a genome!
- 🙃 Fun fact: If you could type 60 words per minute, eight hours a day, it would take about 50 years to type out the human genome
