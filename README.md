-  Hi, I’m SAKSHI
-  I am based in Bengaluru, India
-  I’m currently learning machine learning and its applications in single-cell spatial transcriptomics analysis
-  I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to NGS data analysis and machine learning
-  Reach me at sakshiydv08@gmail.com – I reply faster than a DNA polymerase replicating a genome!
-  Fun fact: If you could type 60 words per minute, eight hours a day, it would take about 50 years to type out the human genome 🙃
