👋 Hi, I’m SAKSHI <br>
📍 I am based in Bengaluru, India <br>
👩🏻‍💻 I’m currently learning machine learning and its applications in single-cell spatial transcriptomics analysis <br>
🤝🏼 I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to NGS data analysis and machine learning <br>
📩 Reach me at <sakshiydv08@gmail.com> – I reply faster than a DNA polymerase replicating a genome! <br>
🙃 Fun fact: If you could type 60 words per minute, eight hours a day, it would take about 50 years to type out the human genome <br>
